    I purchased a groupon, for my 7 month old with some developmental delays (i was so nervous about his first photoshoot) and made his appointment for a Saturday morning. EASY BREEZY!

    I got there about 10 minutes before his appointment and an employee, a male with dirty blonde hair looked me up and down, then walked away. I wasn't sure what I was supposed to do. About 5 minutes later a female employee said that someone would assist me in a few minutes. 
    
    I waited for about 10 more minutes...NOTHING....NADA...
    
    A young lady walked in with her daughter and she was immediately greeted by the male employee...her appointment was about 20 minutes later than mine and he told her that she was next in line!! 
    
    WTF??!! I then did HIS JOB by introducing myself and told him I was there first. He completely ignored the fact that I had waited for so good long and told me I was "checked in"
    
    The other woman and her daughter were then seen before me and my son...I ABSOLUTELY HATE PULLING THE RACE CARD but I took this personally. Hmmmm....
    
    The photographer was great. Really patient with my son. They said his pictures would be ready in a couple of weeks and they would call me....yeah..no call received.  I just had my sister go up there about a month later and get them. 
    
    His pictures turned out better than I expected. But you kind of get what you pay for here. My kiddo has a lot of hair and some of his fro was cut off. 
    
    I haven't made up my mind if I'll be back. They're very affordable, I would just rather deal with someone else than that one guy....

<p>It's not terrible.  If you find a cheap package it can work as long as you plan to only stick to the package items.  Any change is an unreasonable price.
    The photographer was patient and we got a handful of decent pics.
    For the price, it's fine.</p>
